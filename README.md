Creating a simple pharmacy management system with PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and MySQL on a XAMPP server is a great project to understand how to work with a full-stack web application
**Project Structure :-
1)PHP Files: For backend logic (e.g., index.php, add_medicine.php, edit_medicine.php).
2)CSS File: For styling (style.css).
3)JavaScript File: For client-side validation (script.js).
4)MySQL Database: To store medicine data.
5)Start XAMPP and go to phpMyAdmin (usually at http://localhost/phpmyadmin )
6)index.php â€“ Home Page and Medicine Listing
7)Place the files in the htdocs/pharmacy folder within your XAMPP installation directory.
8)Visit http://localhost/pharmacy/index.php to view and manage the pharmacy inventory.
